    description: `The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 
      It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence 
      by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly 
      as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is 
      by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.`,

      object known to harbor life. While large amounts of water can be found throughout 
      the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's

      System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half 
      times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with 
      its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.`
