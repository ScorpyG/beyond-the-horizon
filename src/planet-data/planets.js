    description: `The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 
      It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence 
      by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly 
      as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is 
      by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. 
      The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun's 
      volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity 
      holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the 
      biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. 
      The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 
      27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). 
      The Sun's activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady 
      stream of charged particles it sends out, influences the nature of 
      space throughout the solar system.`,

    description: `The smallest planet in our solar system and closest to the 
      Sun—is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Mercury is the fastest 
      planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. From the surface of 
      Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does 
      when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times 
      brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest 
      planet in our solar system - that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks 
      to its dense atmosphere. Because of Mercury's elliptical - egg-shaped - 
      orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and 
      rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens 
      in reverse at sunset.`

    name: `Venus`,
    radius: `6,051.8 km`,
    surface_area: `460.2 million km²`,
    orbital_time: `225 days`,
    description: `Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after 
      the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object 
      in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be 
      visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus has a thick, toxic 
      atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it's perpetually shrouded in thick, 
      yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse 
      effect. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is 
      closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees 
      Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) - hot enough to melt lead.  The surface 
      is a rusty color and it's peppered with intensely crunched mountains and 
      thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it's possible some volcanoes 
      are still active. Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface - more 
      than 90 times that of Earth - similar to the pressure you'd encounter 
      a mile below the ocean on Earth.`

    description: `Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical 
      object known to harbor life. While large amounts of water can be found throughout 
      the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About 71% of Earth's 
      surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes and rivers. 
      Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets 
      closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. The name Earth is 
      at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after 
      Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, 
      which simply means "the ground."`
